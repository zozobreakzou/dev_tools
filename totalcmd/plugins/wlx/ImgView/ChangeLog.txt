-----------------------------------------------------------------

            (Acknowledgements to Mike Lischke for providing the

            cial Total Commander 'Addons/Plugins' website.

            (Acknowledgements to Gabi Müller, Stefano Bertolucci, 
            Anitzia Solis-Fuentes, Ola Montan, Pieter Hoogenboom, 
            Paul van der Heyden, Elmar Junker.) 

2006-11-15  Printer bug fixed. (Crashed if no printer is install-
            ed.)

2006-12-29  Workaround for INI file bug. (Crashed if TC had been 
            installed to the 'Program Files' directory and if the 
            user didn't have administrative rights.)

2006-12-29  Workaround for TIF bug. (Crashed with some TIF format 
            versions.) Support of TIF files compressed with 'CCIT 
            Group 4 Fax' will be postponed to a later version of 
            ImgView.

2007-01-11  Bilingual error messages problem fixed.

2007-01-11  Image files which are in use by another process are 
            now still accessible to ImgView (however, at the ex-
            pense of the possible occurrence of an exception if 
            such a file is modified while being read by ImgView).

2007-01-11  INI file workaround (see 2006-12-29) replaced by sav-
            ing this file to the user specific APPDATA path if 
            available. This feature will become absolutely essen-
            tial with the Windows Vista operating system.

2007-01-18  If the Windows XP style is selected the checked/un-
            checked state of menu items with glyphs is not visib-
            ly discernible as it is when using the Windows class-
            ic style (which I do). Bug fixed by replacing these 
            nice little glyphs by the good old check mark in case 
            the Windows XP style is detected. (Sorry but that's 
            penalty you will have to pay for using this silly 
            candy style XP look!)

2007-01-18  Display of ImgView error messages made optional. 
            ("Show ImgView error messages" menu item added.)

2007-08-10  Support of THM image file type added. (In reality 
            these THM thumbnail files created by Canon cameras 
            for each AVI videoclip are nothing else but ordinary 
            JPG image files.)

2007-08-11  Support of CUR (cursors) and ANI (animated cursors) 
            image file types added. (Display of animated cursors 
            will only be static.)

2007-08-15  Support of JPEG image file type added. JPEG (being 
            just an alias for JPG) and JPG both use the same en-
            coding.

2007-09-15  Option for automatic image orientation added (accord-
            ing to the "orientation" tag in the Exif meta data).

2008-03-04  EMF and WMF images are now copied to the clipboard in 
            two formats: as a vector graphic (as before) and as a 
            bitmap (new feature).

ImgView.wlx   V 2.0   2009-01-10   (C) M. Diegelmann

-----------------------------------------------------------------


2009-01-10  GIF support extended to animated GIF (using Anders 
            Melander's GifImage library, adapted to Borland Del-
            phi 7 and currently maintained by Finn Tolderlund).

2009-01-10  Faster JPEG loading using the Intel JPEG Library 
            IJL15.dll.

2009-01-18  Support of PSPIMAGE image file type extension added. 
            PSPIMAGE (being just an alias for PSP) and PSP both 
            use the same encoding.

2009-11-26  Optional anti aliasing added.
